# streamz
High level streams API for fast prototyping and experiments.

Streamz allows you to connect to streaming platforms such as Apache Kafka without getting into the details of a specific platform. Current roadmap includes the support of Apache Kafa and AWS Kinesis. 

**Important.** This is still a very early version and the API may change from time to time. Please use with consideration of this fact.
